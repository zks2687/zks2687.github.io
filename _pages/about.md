Hi there! My name is Jinchang Zhou. Iâ€™m a first-year MPhil student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK), advised by Prof. Gen Li. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in June 2025.
